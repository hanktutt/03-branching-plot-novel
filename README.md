# 03-Branching-plot-novel

I have created a simple novel-story based game about a lunar mission to find the dark side of the moon. There are choices that result in losing the game, and there are a couple paths you can take that leads you to dark side of the moon. A little added objective is to steal the aliens treasure and also make it to the dark side of the moon!
